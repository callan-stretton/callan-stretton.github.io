              <ul>
                <p>
                  <li>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</li>
                 I did the mindfulness conversation with my girlfriend. We had several conversation topics, the first was what we'd like to have in our dream home and I found the Mindful Listening really helped me visualise the things she was describing. and was able to Loop back a lot of the small details. When she was talking about her trip Disney Land I found my mind kept Dipping to my experiences of Disney Land and as such I missed out on minor details when Looping. Overall I think I did fine. My girlfriend didn't dip as much but missed out a few small details. In the end, she thought I was pushing for us to go to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter next year. (She may have been right.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</li>
                  I think the third option of taking a Mindful Breath would be the best option for me as it creates the intention to medidate, leading to follow-up forms of meditation during the day such as Mindful Walking.
                </P>

                <p>
                  <li>Any other musings?</li>
                  I tried the walking meditation by focusing on the physical aspects of lifting my legs and placing my feet on the ground. I was doing really well until I turned onto Cuba Street where my mind was constantly getting distracted by sights, sounds and smells but I tried to pull myself back each time.
