              <ul>
                <p>
                  Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Got blocked on a simple problem</li>
                    <li>Solved a problem in an elegant way</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                  In both cases:
                  <li>What was the problem?</li>
                  On this particular webpage there were 9 dots on the screen, and when you clicked on them they would change a different colour depending on how you clicked on them. There was also a counter at the side that would tell you how many of that colour there were at any given time. My problem was figuring out a way to scan all the dots, check their colour, then add it to the counter.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>What problem solving techniques did you use?</li>
                  I first went to the Slack Channel to see if anyone else was having a similar problem. I also had Sachin look over it in person, but many of these terms were new to both of us. I got talking to Daz on the Slack Channel and she pointed out that I had missed a bracket and had spelled something wrong. I tried again but ran into new errors. Copying these errors into Google, solved one issue but another would pop up. I started to look at certain lines individually and printing them to the ‘console’, this helped me see what each part was doing. Finally I could see a clear path and got it to work!
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
                  I felt frustrated but also determined to get it working. When I got it to work though I was over the moon.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>What did you learn?</li>
                  I learnt to look thoroughly at my spelling and syntax. Also to ask for help, another pair of eyes can spot something you might not. I also found the debugger a great tool, only after I'd done this exercise.

                </p>

                <p>
                  Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
                  <li>Pseudocode</li>
                  I really benefit from using pseudocode, as it helps me break down the process of what I've got to do and also for when I run into problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Trying something</li>
                  I definitely benefited from trying things and search on Google for how to approach the concept.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                  This is good, I've used it a couple of times, I also like to write down what I know/don't know and what I need it to do.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Reading error messages</li>
                  In the end, reading the error messages helped me nail the problem, knowing what line to focus on and using Google to determine what the error meant.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Console.logging</li>
                  I was able to see what information was coming out of certain fuctions and loops by adding the console.log, I'll be sure to use it again.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Googling</li>
                  People on the net seemed to have had similar issues, just in different contexts, so being able to break down what they were trying to do and what I would like to do helped me to know which parts I need to use in my code and how that code works.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                  Another great life-saver! I was able to get a second opinion on my code and things like tiny spelling mistakes that you can overlook may be picked up on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                  Another great thing about Slack, I had my question on JavaScript answered by a coach and that was very helpful.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
                  Any time I make a mistake, I write it down and add it to my notes like "don't forget to use this" or "a value you must be added here".
                </p>

                <p>
                  Explain to your non-tech friend
                  Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:
                  <li>.map()</li>
                  Will create a new array from an existing one that applies a function to all the elements inside that array without affecting the original.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>.filter()</li>
                  Creates a new array from an existing one but only lets through certain information depending on what condition you give it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>.reduce()</li>
                  Reduces an array to a single value by applying a function against an accumulator.
                </p>
