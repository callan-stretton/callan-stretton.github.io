              <h2>Meditation Process 30/07/17</h2>
              <ul>
                <p>
                  <li>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</li>
                  This allowed me to not get so hung up on certain details and progress onto the next element and look at the webpage as a whole. Once I've got the main elements in place, that's when I'll look into making it look tidy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</li>
                  I thought meditation was good practice for clearing your mind and focusing on what's important. Getting rid of distractions.
                </P>

                <p>
                  <li>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</li>
                  I learned that the process of getting into the meditave state isn't as easy for beginners as flicking a switch but one where you need to constantly be bringing yourself back and concentrating on listening to your breath through meta-attention. I also found it interesting thst they say the default state of mind is happiness and that by exercising your brain you will notice a similar difference to that of physically exercising your body.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</li>
                  Being in a seated position with my eyes closed and listening to my breath and focusing. I like the idea of acknowledging something like a distraction and accepting it, but not caving in to give it attention.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Any other musings?</li>
                  I like the analogies used in this article. First, that the mind can be like a body of water with sedament and when it is stirred the water becomes murky, but with a concentrated mind the water/mind is clear. I also like the one where it's like riding a bike, you may wobble a bit at first (as you begin practising) with keeping your mind focused eventually you'll be by making micro-recoveries and even a pure steady run on the flat, pure concentration.
