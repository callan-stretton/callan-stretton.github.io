                  <li>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</li>
                  The relationship is a close one, because they both reflect upon your emotions and how to act on them , they are essentially the same thing. I could relate to the analogy of the flagpole and found it fascinating, this is the flag being the mind in the presence of strong emotions, the wind. Because as I was grounding my emotions in the Body Scan exercise, I had an image of a bed spread pegged on a clothes line flapping rapidly in the wind on a beach of grey skies. I could hear the noise, similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od8_CBE-n6c">this noise</a>. The flagpole in the analogy represents mindfulness keeping it all steady, perhaps this is a sign I need to strengthen my clothesline of mindfulness?

                <p>
                  <li>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</li>
                  I found the Body Scan to be an interesting exercise, and I agree that afterwards I do feel really relaxed, like I go to sleep (in the middle of the afternoon). At various points I paid attention to different things. When I was focusing on the head I noticed where my teeth met and the way they gently touched each other. My eyes were moving slightly. And when I focused on the neck and shoulders, I could feel the slight strain of my neck keeping my head up. Nothing was felt in my back, but in my chest I felt a warm sensation, almost like I was thirsty (so I had to go have a drink, I probably was thirsty). Returning to the full body scan, I felt my eyes moving up and down my body like I was scanning from head to toe from within my eyelids, and felt no strong emotion standing out to me. Recalling a happy emotion brough about a feeling in my throat where I wanted to express this through laughter or cheering. The grounding was an interesting sensation, it was similar to staying in a bath after you've pulled the plug, I felt heavier and sleepy afterwards. Would consider doing this before going to bed.

                <p>
                  <li>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</li>
                  That you shouldn't perceive your emotions as being who you are. They are more like phenomena. It's about shifting your perception to "I am sad" to "I feel sad". It's about recognising you're experiencing these emotions, and in a way it's not dissimilar to pain you get after a workout. What you do with that is your choice; acknowledge it, ignore it, or experience it mindfully. Either way, it isn't who you are.
