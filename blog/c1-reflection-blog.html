        <p>
          <li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li>
          It sounds like EDA is quite a unique and inspiring learning experience and one that allows for more creativity than your typical course.
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>What are your impressions?</li>
          This course will get you to work together and help each other progress. I like the analogy that everyone will come together like chefs in a kitchen working together to reach the end result.
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li>
          As an introverted person it may be hard for me at first but I know I will be alright once I jump straight into it.
        </P>

        <p>
          <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li>
          My expectations of EDA haven't changed too much from the Day in the Life event, but before that I guess I thought it wouldn't be as involved and team-based.
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li>
           I'm probably somewhere between nervous and excited. I'm not used to this style of learning, I'm hoping I can just step-in and embrace it.
        </p>
