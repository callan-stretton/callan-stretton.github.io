          <li>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</li>
          I learned that emotional intelligence isn't just about empathy, a lot of it has to do with understanding yourself, your physiology, and training your mind. An interesting concept was looking into how your body reacts to certain emotions such as anger and knowing when and how to respond. You can also use meditation to train your mind and not react so instinctively to negative sounds or situations, by assessing what's happening and then responding.

          <li>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</li>
          I found the two minutes of mindfulness calming. I tried to focus on my breathing but so many other thoughts were popping into my head. I had to wear earplugs too because the wind where I am is so strong. I will need to work on emptying my mind and not anticipating the end of the two minutes.
