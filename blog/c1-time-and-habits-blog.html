        I tried the Pomodoro technique and Starting Small idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>What did you find interesting?</li>
        I found the growth mindset interesting as it focuses on developing your abilities and allowing your actions to drive your confidence rather than having a definite, fixed mindset.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>What worked for you?</li>
        I found that by not being overwhelmed by the large task at hand, it's best to break it down and focus on the small things. The Pomodoro technique helped as well to drown out distractions and give tasks my undivided attention.

      <p>
        <li>Which will you experiment further with?</li>
        Growth mindset, Pomodoro, and thinking small.
