          List of Ideas I would like to implement in my site:
          <li>Integrate the header image into the rest of the page with a smooth transition.</li>
          <li>When changing the display size, certain elements will change to accomodate this.</li>
          <li>Have a separate side-bar for my blog posts.</li>
          <li>Have some sort of shadow effect to pop the main wrapper from the background.</li>

        </p>

        <p>
          <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</li>
          HTML houses the structure/elements of the page and all its contents, like a skeleton. These are in the form of tags. CSS allows you to select these elements and tell the browser how they all should look. The DOM (Document Object Model) breaks the page down and arranges the elements into a tree structure to give a map/model of the page. Here you can easily see the familial relationship of all the elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>What is meant by boxifying design?</li>
          This is the process of taking a design layout for a webpage and visually deconstructing it, dividing it up into separate boxes. In many cases there will boxes within boxes. This is essentially chopping it up into different elements.
        </P>

        <p>
          <li>What is the box model?</li>
          The box model indicates what values of a container you can change. Starting with the content itself, for exmple some text, you can change the size of the space the text operates in. The next level up from that is the padding, this is the area between the content and the container. Then the container itself can be altered by changing the border. Lastly, the margin is what surrounds the border of the container, and how close it gets to outside objects.
