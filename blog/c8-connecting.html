                <p>
                  <li>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</li>
                  I found it greatly improved my rapport with people and I found that I could have more in depth conversations. I like the idea that you assume everyone has good intentions until otherwise proven. I feel like this is the right approach and I hope it won’t lead to disappointment in someone’s attitudes. I feel like it won’t as within conversations you get an idea for who these people are and a little snippet of their values and what they stand for. I feel a few people treat employees (like wait staff in a restaurant) as an extension of the business and I have a always actively gone out of my way to treat everyone as people and consider their feelings when speaking to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</li>
                  This was an interesting experience as it got me engaging on a deeper level than just mindful listening. I was able to get to the root of my girlfriend’s emotions and through this exercise we both able to pinpoint where these emotions had originated from. I found the process to be more immersive than the previous pair exercises and will likely use this method in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</li>
                  This exercise had a feeling of sharing the love to it, which I found lined up with my values and how I perceive my interaction with other people. The exercise did a good job of breaking this down and highlighting just how much our experiences can align and that we are all not so different. It’s a great way to make you feel good about yourself.

                  <li>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</li>

                    <li>
                      The example I am reflecting on is one where myself and my girlfriend were looking to move into our first flat. I had found one I liked and she still had another month of study to complete in Dunedin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      I had been looking around for a flat a bit earlier than she would have liked as I was concerned about all the good flats being snapped up by students finishing their courses. I went to the open-home and thought I had a good idea for the type of place we would both like and started to make the steps to secure this apartment as it was in a good central location, reasonably priced, and had a lot of interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Because we were both going to be living together for the first time, it would be better for us to choose a place together and agree on one we are both happy on. Her flatting experience and knowledge would be valuable in knowing what to look out for at viewings. She hadn’t even finished study and the added stress of me rushing into an apartment was not a good combo.
