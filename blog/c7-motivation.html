              <h2>Motivation 21/08/17</h2>
              <ul>
                <p>
                  <li>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</li>
                  There are three main forms of happiness:

                  The first is Pleasure, which has a reputation for being "rock-star" form of happiness as it is based on chasing the next high. This form of happiness is highly unstable as it is hard to maintain.
                   Then there’s Passion/Flow, which is a blend of peak performance and peak engagement.
                  Also known as “being in the zone”, a state of focused attention that a lot of athletes experience. In this instance, time seems to fly by and and is regarded as a much more sustainable form of happiness than pleasure is, as it's not as easy to become accustomed to it.
                  And finally, Higher Purpose. This is the notion of being part of something bigger than yourself. This form of happiness is very resilient and the most sustainable of the three. It is suggested that we naturally seek Pleasure but we should instead be looking into Higher Purpose, then Passion and lastly Pleasure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
                  <li>What are your core values?</li>
                  I value my family, my close friends, honesty, and being able to have a laugh.

                  <li>What do you stand for?</li>
                  Looking out for one another, and helping those in need. Never put someone down or make them feel uncomfortable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</li>
                  I like the idea that the ocean metaphor for happiness can be applied to resilience, and this that happiness/resilience is a deep ocean, the surface can be choppy but it always calm deep down.
                  The meditation exercise was interesting as it got you to recount both a time of success and failure. It got you to recognise the emotions but not to react to them, which is a hard thing to do when you are recounting such events. I found this to be quite calming.
